# React Art Gallery

React Art Gallery is a front-end web application that utilizes third-party data from the [Art Institute of Chicago API](https://api.artic.edu/docs/#quick-start) to allow users to search, view, and learn more about artworks in their collections.  Made with React, React Router, and CSS.

## User Stories:
I created user stories to get a stronger understanding and better perspective of the project's features from the eyes of a prospective user.
- As a user I want to be able to search for artworks with different search options.
- As a user I want to be able to see enlarged images of art.
- As a user I want to be able to see information about the artwork and the artist.
- As a user I want to be able to go back to the main screen.
- As a user I want to be able to select the number of search results.





## How to Use
Use the search bar to search for artworks by keyword. This keyword can be an artist, an artstyle, a medium, a country of origin - the search will return all artworks whose metadata contains some mention of the keyword.

Click on an artwork to see more details and a larger version of the artwork image. Click on 'Back to Search Rusults' to return to the search results page.

## Future Goals & Features
- Infinite scroll or pagination of results.
- Component that renders and displays other artworks from that artist.
- Display random results upon page loading
- Create your own personal gallery - use can save their favorite artworks to view later. 
- Option to choose the amount of search results.
